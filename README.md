# merge-overlapping-intervals

Difficulty: medium

  Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of arbitrary intervals,
  merges any overlapping intervals, and returns the new intervals in no
  particular order. Each interval interval  is an array of two integers, with
  interval[0]  as the start of the interval and interval[1]  as the end of the interval. 
  Note that back-to-back intervals aren't considered to be overlapping. For
  example, [1, 5] and [6, 7] aren't overlapping; however, [1, 6] and [6, 7] are  indeed
  overlapping. Also note that the start of any particular interval will always be less than
  or equal to the end of that interval.
